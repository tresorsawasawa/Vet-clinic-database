# Vet Clinic Database
## Description

> "Vet Clinic Database" is a project where I use a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic that includes a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

## Details

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- [schema.sql](https://github.com/tresorsawasawa/Vet-clinic-database/blob/feature/create-animals-table/schema.sql) to create all tables.
- [data.sql](https://github.com/tresorsawasawa/Vet-clinic-database/blob/feature/create-animals-table/data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- [queries.sql](https://github.com/tresorsawasawa/Vet-clinic-database/blob/feature/create-animals-table/queries.sql) examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. 

This project is built with:
